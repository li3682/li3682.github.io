Hello, 

I'm Jianyao Li, currently a big data engineer at China Entercom. I earned my master's degree from Purdue University, West Lafayette, and my bachelor's degree from the Guangdong University of Technology. I am experienced in Java and Python development, Hadoop big data ecosystems, and applications & research on machine learning models. Recently, I have been working on an LLC-integrated BI platform. It won [Computer Weekly 2024](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366579855/CW-Innovation-Awards-Gleaning-data-insights-with-AI). Previously, when I was a data engineer at XPeng Motors Inc, I led the data-flow design of EMS(Energy Management System), providing IoT-collected industrial data service for management layer and ensuring data quality and delivery.

I'm interested in **Spatial Temporal Data**, **Time Series Analysis**, and **Data Mining**. I want to connect the real world with virtual data and, vice versa, provide the real world with valuable data and algorithm services. Please reach out to me if you have any questions!
