Hello, 

I'm Jianyao Li, currently a big data engineer in China Entercom. I earned my master's degree from Purdue University, West Lafayette and bachelor's degree from Guangdong University of Technology. I am experienced in Java and Python development, Hadoop bigdata ecosystems, and applications \& research on machine learning models. Recently, I am working on a LLC integrated BI platform, and it won [Computer Weekly 2024](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366579855/CW-Innovation-Awards-Gleaning-data-insights-with-AI). Previously, when I was a data engineer in XPeng Motors Inc, I lead the data-flow design of EMS(Energy Management System), providing IoT-collected industrial data service for management layer and ensuring data quality and delivery.

I'm interested in Spatial Temporal Data, Time Series Analysis, and Data Mining. I hope to connect the real-world with virtual data, and vice versa, provide the real-world a valuable data and algorithm service. Please reach out to me if you have any questions!
